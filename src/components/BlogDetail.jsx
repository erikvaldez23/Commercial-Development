          1. Why Are There Window Tint Laws?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Laws exist to ensure safe driving conditions by preventing excessive
          darkness, which can limit visibility and make law enforcement

        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          VLT% determines how much light can pass through a tinted window. A
          lower VLT% means a darker tint.

          1. What is a Ceramic Coating?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          A ceramic coating is a **liquid polymer** that chemically bonds to
          your car‚Äôs paint, creating a **hydrophobic surface** that repels
          water, dirt, and contaminants.

        <Typography>
          ‚úÖ **UV Protection** - Prevents oxidation and paint fading. ‚úÖ
          **Hydrophobic Properties** - Makes washing easier, as dirt and water
          slide off. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Gloss** - Creates a deep, mirror-like shine
          on your car.

        <Typography>
          If you want **long-term protection**, reduced maintenance, and a
          glossy finish, ceramic coatings are a great investment. However, they
          **do not make your car scratch-proof**, so proper maintenance is still
          required.

          1. What is Paint Protection Film (PPF)?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a **clear polyurethane film** applied
          to a car‚Äôs exterior to protect against rock chips, scratches, and UV
          damage.
